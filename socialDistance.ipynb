    "# Problem Description.\n",

    "You’re trying really hard to adhere to social distancing rules, but sometimes your visits to the local park aren’t so easy. You’re trying to get from a point on the south side of the park to a nice patch of grass on the north side. There are several people around and sometimes they aren’t trying as hard as you to do the right thing. But you’ve had a great idea! You launch a drone and create a map of the current location of all of the people in the park. Now you just have to write a little program to find a path such that you stay 6 feet away from every other park-goer!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simplify the problem somewhat you divide the part of the park you need to traverse into a 25×25 grid, where each square is 1 foot by 1 foot. You only worry about moving north, east, or west (no looping back to the south). You decide to measure the 6-foot distance from the center of each square using the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, [0,0] and [0,6] are 6 feet apart, while [0,0] and [4,3] are only 5 feet separated.\n",

    "Above is a sample configuration of the park. It is possible different positions on the south side of the park might be specified, and the other park-goers might be in different places. The path shown is simply the first path my solution produced – yours may do something different!\n",
    "\n",
    "In ASP you will create a program which automatically finds and outputs a path through the park, given a starting position on the south edge of the park, the size of the park, the goal Y coordinate, and the positions of any other people in the park.\n",
